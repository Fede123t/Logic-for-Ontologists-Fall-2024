**Particular Universes Playtest Session A**

Please discuss and answer as a group.
Shuffle the A cards and play a couple of rounds.

1. Are the provided rules and explanation sufficient? What’s missing?
The rules are sufficient to play, but more rules will enhance the playing experience and make it smoother. Not necessarily more rules to be learnt, but stringer rules, that would constraint the actions of the player more, plus some study on costs and benefits of each actions.

2. Are there sufficient cards in the deck? Or too many?
The cards were sufficient

There are sufficient cards given the number of suggested players, and the ratio among cards seem good at first glance. A more thorough analysis might suggest some changes, given more rules and a quantifications of the micro-objectives every player has while trying to pursue the major objective of running out of cards. A just mention that in deck A having classes like *Eating A* or *Opening The* is a bit strange. Given you want to suggest a concatenations of classes even the simple *Eating* and *Opening* would do. You can exploit the common understanding in English subjects some before verbs and object clauses come after verbs. You can also mae this explicit in the rulebook. Moreover, there is no class BFO:Entity in deck A. 

3. Should there be more cards of any particular kind in the deck e.g. more or less occurrent, object, generically dependent continuant cards, etc.?

The number should certainly not be reduced. Given the same kinds of cards and the same kind of rules, some more cards for unique individuals might be added. For example, 
Other cards to be added depend on the change or rules that might be envisioned.

4. What other text or picture cards could be added to extend the existing ones?

Almost all the cards depict BFO:Objects. Either some cards for individual qualities, spatial regions, processes are added, or an additional rule for which cards of individuals can be legally interpreted in many ways should be added. Imagine a picture of an individual cat on the mat in the foreground: can i pick the mat, instead of the mat as the primary referent of the card? Or the sleeping of the cat? Etc.
You can add cards for indiscernible individuals, like pictures of spherical metal balls taken from the same perspective. 
Tricky cards for individuals might be those depicting countries and governments.


5. Do players win too quickly, or does it take too long to win?

We played one game with ontology experts and beginners in about three hours, because there were much discussion. We actually played in about ten people and only one or two players had the chance to play two hands, the rest played one only. 
Instead, when I played with engineers with no ontology experience, we finished in 20min. They did not care much about BFO classes and they just followed my explanations, and they did not raise many objections to other players putting down cards.


6. If there were spectators watching you play the game, did they engage in the discussions? Or join the game?

We didn't have an attentive audience. Almost everyone in the room was a player, and the few who weren't and had no ontological training did not engage.

7. What additional cards could be added to for “quality” relative to the existing themes?

Easy cases of cards to be added as BFO:Quality, either as classes or as individuals, could be: colors like white, black, orange...; solidity features like: compact, squishy, fragile...; aesthetic features like beautiful, ugly, sad...
Of course, some of these entities might be considered BFO:Dispositions or even something else, which adds some spice to the discussion.


**Particular Universes playtest session 2**

Please discuss and answer as a group
Add the B cards to the deck, shuffle and play a couple of rounds.

1. Are there too many cards now or does it work?

The number of cards is good, as well as the ration between individuals, classes and spell cards. Of course, these numbers and ration must be reconsidered if more than five players are added or rules are changed.

2. Does it take longer to win? Too long?

This was the session we took 3h to finish. but it was more due to the kind of players more than the cards themselves. In my opinion, the cards added from the B deck are more difficult to categorize on average, but this did not influence much our game. Cards like Coordinates or those for Object Aggregate can be tricky.
I must note that, against what is in the deck, the constellation Canes Venatici cannot be a class according to BFO, but it is an individual.

3. What additional cards could be added to augment the B cards (e.g. function, immaterial entities, temporal region, etc.) relative to existing themes?

Regarding instances, you could add technical images of artifacts being used, maybe with arrows of movement for screwdrivers and pulleys, plus cards representing the objects screwdrivers and pulleys instead of their functions. For immaterial entities you can use drawings with dashed lines. For temporal regions you can use an artifact, like a clock or a calendar, and focus on what they measure. 

4. What additional themes (text and picture cards) could be added to the game relative to the B cards?

Regarding instances, you can add natural entities like nebulas and clouds that have a distinctive shape of some other recognizable entity, like a cat or a sombrero. Then, someone can combine the classes Cat and Nebula, so that that strange-looking nebula is the only instance that it can get, and not a normal nebula. Same for the rest of the cards, maybe even immaterial entities with weird shapes. 



**Particular Universes playtest session 3**

Please discuss and answer as a group

For each round in this session, deal each player 6 cards plus one blank card, and play the game. During the course of the round each player can write on their card and play it in the game.
After each round, these cards should be shuffled into the deck with the other cards and become part of the game.

*please use a pencil so the cards can be reused
**please do not add wildcards
***you can write and play your card immediately, or add it somewhere in
the deck for another player to draw
****blank cards can be written in secret, or decide together what cards should be added

1. Do your cards make sense as you play? In subsequent rounds did other players draw your cards and play them as intended?

We actually did not play with the blank spell cards, but I imagined how they could be used. You are giving many options here, like writing and playing immediately, writing in advance, writing together the blank cards. There is no instructions about  the blank cards can be filled with contents that are neither instances, nor classes nor spells. What if someone plays an alien card, like Nothingness, or something he claims being a "principle", whatever it is, that is neither a class nor an instance? How do we behave there?

2. Do you think that writing cards should be part of the final game?

I would focus on refining the basic rules before giving the players the ability to make new cards for instances, classes or spells. The contemplated ability of writing and immediately  playing a cards seems too much and people would have too powerful cads in the most convenient of situations. Blank cards should be decided in advance as they were expansions, and then added to the deck. It would be a personalized expansion, and this could be seen in the most recent version of Uno.

3. What new picture cards (particulars) could be added to support your new cards?

This depends on the imagination of the players drawing on blank cards. You can add as a rule that for every new class added with blank card, at least an instance should be added, or whatever that would preserve the initial ratio of the deck without blank cards.


**Particular Universes playtest overall**

1. Is the game fun to play?

The game can be really fun among ontologists or metaphysicians, especially those with some knowledge in BFO. There is little need of refreshing theories and there is still room for debate, especially attacks against rival theories and passionate defenses to gain more votes. When the players are not metaphysicians the attack and defense of theories that justify a certain hand almost evaporates and so much of the fun.

2. What did you like most about the game?

It is a good pedagogical tool that everyone can use while supported by a teacher during the play, or if there are enough experts as players. If you wanted a larger public, many considerations must be done, among which the reduction or simplification of the Top Level Ontology to be used. Maybe a focus on domain ontologies will be better, with more rules on the allowed syntax of combining classes, adding subclasses, adding instances and so on. It would be good to let the unexperienced stumble upon problems that maybe a TLO has solved.

3. Was there anything you didn’t like about the game?

The lack of rules in various scenarios, or the lack of trade-offs between attack and defense strategies. What I mean is that players, since they just have the goal of running out of cards, could do anything, in principle, to stop the other players to do so.
First, it is always convenient for a player to vote against the card play of another player. Yes, a new interesting class can be added, but it is so easy to play cards in general, that this benefit never constitute a real trade-off.
Second, the spell card Drama dump is is over powered. Especially if compared with other spell cards. There is almost no use of *Plagiarism*, for example, since my hand does not influence that much the next hand even if I know the cards of the next player. 
Third, using all cards in one hand is over powered. Almost everyone, especially experienced ontologists, can win in one move, given the current state of the deck and rules. Moreover, even if someone doesn't win in one move, he takes too much time for himself playing all cards he can, while the other players just listen of vote against. 

4. What new rules might make the game more fun, entertaining, informative, or challenging?
5. 
There are many things that can be improved in Particular Universes.
For example, decide if you want a flexible or a rigid syntax of putting down cards. To be precise, a rigid syntax means that cards put down and combined in a certain way can never be moved. If A has been accepted as the superclass of B, then I cannot add C as a middleclass between A and C. Or, decide in the rules to make it flexible and add classes to already existing structures. 
A second interesting rule is that, since every play of a card on the table is liable of being justified in front of the other player, make the justification cumulative. What this means is that is that is A is superclass of B and X is an instance of B, then, if I add C as superclass of A, i should not only justify that but also that C is a superclass of B and that an instance of C is X. So adding more classes can become more and more difficult while we proceed in the game.
 

5. Can you suggest any new wildcards?

The wildcard or spell card *Domain Expert*, that make you immune to any vote against when you put a card on the table. The spell card *Ontology winter*, that makes the next player use only spell cards for his turn, but no classes nor instances. The spell card *Academic rambling*, that changes the intended meaning of a class label and the meaning of all its subclasses. 

6. Can you suggest any aesthetic additions or improvements for the game?

After five or six cards are put down on the table, the situation gets chaotic. We do not distinguish instances of a class from those of a sibling class, if classes are concatenated or just siblings, nor if they have this parent class of another. Plus, we keep moving classes and instances , given the flexible syntax that we implemented while playing. Adding wool threads to connect the cards might be of some help, but not perfect. Adding a big grid under the cards and putting them in order might be slightly better. Of course, going digital would make everything extremely clear. 


7. Can you suggest any additions or improvements for understandability?

Well, you can add papers and book on ontology to enhance the understanding of the used TLO, but it would be a bummer, not fun. Just add in the booklet easy examples of classifications given the provided deck. Plus, determine if you want to just play with labels of the cards and their average understanding, or if every player must come up with a definition of the class cards he plays, and that this should be annotated for future reference.

8. How much prior introduction to the BFO ontology do you feel is necessary to
play this game?

Knowing at least the distinction between Continuant and Occurrents, and Specifically dependent Continuants and independent continuants was necessary. Some of the rest can be intuited, or asked to other players, plus, if it only matters to put down BFO cards, the structure is already given by the diagram that comes with the booklet. Some classes, like GDC, are just too difficult to be used by people in a party game environment. Again, if this is a pedagogical tool. the instructor of the class knows what the players are capable of, and can retract problematic classes, like some from deck A and B.


9. Could this game be played by total beginners?

I tried to play with engineers who have no ideas of ontologies or metaphysical theories. They could add the BFO classes in the right places given the diagram provided with the booklet, but it was a mere hand movement, with no understanding. If i did explain, I took a bit of the time of the real card game, since the information provided might impact very little their gameplay.
If no BFO expert was present during the game, unskilled players would just stop, or spend too much time in learning rules and diminishing the fun. 


10. How does the gameplay compare to listening to a lecture on the ontology,
or reading a publication?

The game is a nice exercise after the lecture on the same topic. We can challenge our peers or even the professor, and maybe come up with theories we never considered in the past. Every pedagogy must comprise an active part form the student, not just a passive one like listening or reading, so the card game is a welcome contribution.

11. Please share any feedback, suggestions for improvement, or
intuitions you had while playing the game.

I would suggest to study some principles of game design that apply to every tabletop game. During the game design, the objective for winning the game should be broken down in micro-objectives and these should be somewhat quantified. So, the actions a player can take should be quantified as costs. In order to achieve an objective or micro-objective, the player faces costs and must make tradeoffs. An example already quoted: playing all cards in one hand is overpowered because it costs nothing and gives all the benefits to reach the objective. Then, when some equilibrium among tradeoffs is reached, do not mention these quantities in the rulebook, but make them emerge given the rules you implement. Those quantities are just the invisible foundation that the player should not be bothered with.
